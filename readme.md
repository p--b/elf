**No, it has nothing to do with Christmas.**

What the hell does this thing do?
--------------------------------
It calculates mic plots\*. If you don't know what these are, this project isn't for you.

What is great about this thing?
------------------------------
Please see the previous question

What is crap about this thing?
------------------------------
Lots. It's not guaranteed to work. At all. Even a little bit.

It still exhibits non-determinism. That's ideal (a feature).

It is just a back-end. No front-end exists yet (boo-hoo).

There are no tests.

There is nil documentation.

There are still bugs.

It doesn't cure any diseases at all (and may in fact give you PTSD).

How do I make this thing do something?
--------------------------------------

    $ python -i test.py
    >>> G()
    >>> print G
